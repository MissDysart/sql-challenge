Module 9 Challenge - SQL

Files and folders in repository:
1. The "data" folder contains the following CSV files provided to complete challenge:
    - departments.csv
    - dept_emp.csv
    - dept_manager.csv

    - ph_queries.sql (my schema for queries used to answer the questions in assignment)

Data Modeling
1. Used quickdatabasediagrams.com to sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables.
2. Captured the result in a screenshot ("employeeERD.PNG") and text file ("schema.txt").

Data Engineering
1. Used pgAmdin to create a table schema for the CSV files provided.
2. Imported the CSV files into the appropriate tables (in the same order as the tables are listed in the table schema "pewlett_hackard.sql") using pgAdmin's import feature.
